# AVLTree
This is the implementation of an AVL tree, that will perform balancing proceedures if the tree becomes unbalanced.
This structure is better than a standard binary tree as the rebalancing will make search functions quicker.
Half of the functions were implemented by the lecturer, while I implemented the other half.
The key was understanding the logic of how the tree was structured.
